				<p class="small">I (missionary), have agreed to be a Participant in the mission trip sponsored in whole or in part by <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a>. In consideration of being allowed to participate in this trip, I hereby state and agree as follows:</p>
				<h5>1. STANDARDS OF CONDUCT</h5>
				<p class="small">A. I agree to abide by <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a>'s conduct regulations and the directions of the group sponsor and his or her designees. I understand that the group sponsor has the right to enforce appropriate standards of behavior and that I may be dismissed from the trip at any time for failure to comply with such standards. <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> reserves the right to physically remove me from the trip at any time should my actions or general behavior impede the trip, or the rights and welfare of any person, including but not limited to my own welfare. Similarly, if my conduct violates any policy or procedure of <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a>, I understand that I may be required to leave the trip at the sole discretion of <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a>'s agents and representatives. I understand that if my participation in the trip is terminated by the group sponsor, I will be sent home with no refund of fees. If I am sent home before completion of the trip, I understand that I will be responsible for any and all costs and expenses associated with my return home.</p>
				<p class="small">B. I acknowledge and understand that, while I am a participant, I am responsible for my own behavior and any legal or financial consequences as I would be if I were not a Participant on the <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> trip.</p>
				<h5>2. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS</h5>
				<p class="small">I understand that <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> does not represent or act as an agent for, and can not control the acts of omissions of, any host institution, host family, transportation carrier, hotel, tour organizer, or other provider of goods or services involved in the trip. I understand that <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> is not responsible for matters that are beyond its control. I hereby release <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> from any injury, loss, damage, accident, delay, or expense arising out of any such matters.</p>
				<h5>3. PROGRAM CHANGES</h5>
				<p class="small">I understand that <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> reserves the right to make cancellations, substitutions, or changes to the trip in its sole discretion, with or without notice, and that <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> shall not be liable for any loss to the Participants by reason of any such cancellation or change. <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> is not responsible for penalties assessed by air carriers that may result due to operational and/or itinerary changes, regardless of whether the Participant or <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> makes a flight arrangement. Any additional expense resulting from the above will be paid by the Participant. <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> reserves the right to substitute hotels or accommodations or housing or a similar category at any time. If I become detached from the group, fail to meet a departure vehicle, airplane, boat, or train, I will at my own expense seek out, contact, and reach the group at its next available destination.</p>
				<h5>4. INDEPENDENT ACTIVITY</h5>
				<p class="small">I understand that, if I choose to travel independently before, after or during my free time in the trip, such travel will be unsupervised by <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a>’s agents or employees. I agree that <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> and its agents and employees shall have no responsibility or liability for injury, damage or loss suffered by me during such periods of independent travel.</p>
				<h5>5. HEALTH AND SAFETY</h5>
				<p class="small">A. I release and absolve <a href="http://Missions.Me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Missions.Me</a> of all responsibility and liability for any injuries, illnesses (including death), claims, damages, charges, bills and/or expenses I may incur while abroad, including all times before, during, and after the duration of the trip.
